            <h3> Ascending to Pathivara: A Tale of Adventure and Faith</h3>
         <p>
            At 3 AM, we set out on our hike up the 12,500 ft. peak in Taplejung, Nepal. This journey was not just a hike for us; it was
            a spiritual quest to reach the Pathivara Temple at the mountain's summit. The Nepalese people believe that any wish made at 
            this temple will be granted by the mountain goddess. Accompanying us were my 7-year-old nephew, Dishant, and his mother, all
            determined to complete this challenging trek.
            <br>
            Dishant grew tired within the first few hundred feet of our journey. Since we were already hours away from home, turning back
            was not an option. Fortunately, we found numerous porters, incredibly strong individuals who agreed to carry Dishant for a 
            small fee.

            I've experienced several hikes before, from Shenandoah National Park in Virginia to Mount Rainier in Seattle. However, this 
            hike in Nepal, which takes 6 hours to ascend and 3-4 hours to descend, was unlike any other. I had never attempted such a 
            long hike (10 hours in a day) or trekked at such a high elevation.

               The scenery from the hill was breathtaking, with nature's vast wilderness all around us. The trail was extremely steep, more 
               akin to climbing than walking. I felt exhausted, and my heartbeat was intense. After 3-4 hours, I needed to rest for 5 minutes
               for every 2 minutes of hiking. What kept me going was seeing an 18-year-old porter running along the trail, carrying my 60 lb 
               nephew, and my 50-year-old mother managing fine. The belief that only a sinful person could not reach the top also motivated 
               me. Some people I knew couldn't continue and had to turn back without reaching the summit.

            Fortunately, all my family members made it to the top. We worshipped the mountain goddess, whose majestic statue felt alive, 
            and each of us made a wish. The reward after such hard work was unforgettable. This beautiful adventure is a memory we will 
            cherish forever.
